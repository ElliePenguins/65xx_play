# 65xx_play
Source files for multiple short programs written for 6502 family of 8bit processors.

The assembler that is used is the cc65 assembler, it is not included in this repository.
There is a very simple build.sh script that is included to make assembling and linking
easier. This script can be modified to work with your file directory structure as required,
and probbobly will be required depending on where you placed your assembler/linker.

The executable files in "bin" can be run with the c64 in vice emulator.
 - Unexpectedly they also run fine on the new C64 mini.
 
 TODO:
  Append .d64 file extension to binaries.
