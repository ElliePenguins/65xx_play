# 65xx_play
Source files for multiple short programs written for 6502 family of 8bit processors.

The assembler that is used is the cc65 assembler, it is not included in this repository.
There is a very simple build.sh script that is included to make assembling and linking
easier. This script can be modified to work with your file directory structure as required.

The source files included are for learning and play purposes.
